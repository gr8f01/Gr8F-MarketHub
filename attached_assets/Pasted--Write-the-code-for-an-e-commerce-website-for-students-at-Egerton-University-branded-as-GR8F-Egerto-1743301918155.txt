5. User Accounts & Dashboards:
Student Dashboard: Students should have a personal dashboard where they can track orders, manage shipping information, and see how many referrals they’ve made and how many vouchers they’ve earned.

Referral Program:

Each student gets a unique referral code or link to share.

Every time a referred student signs up and makes their first transaction, the referring student earns a voucher (which can be a discount or product voucher, customizable by the admin).

Include a feature that allows students to track their referral progress and vouchers earned in their dashboard.

Admin Dashboard: As the admin, you should be able to:

Set guidelines for the referral program (e.g., how many referrals a student needs to earn a voucher).

Set the type of vouchers (discount vouchers, product vouchers) and their expiration dates.

Enable or disable different payment options (e.g., mobile money, bank payments).

Monitor all student activity, including purchases, referrals, and voucher redemptions.

6. Terms and Conditions:
Include a page where students can easily access and read the terms and conditions. This page should be available at registration, and students should agree to it before completing their registration or purchase.

7. Real-Time Chat/Messaging:
Implement a real-time chat feature where students can communicate directly with support or ask about products.

Allow customers to interact with sellers if you're planning to expand the marketplace.

8. Push Notifications:
Send notifications for order updates (e.g., when an order is processed, shipped, or delivered).

Send notifications for new product arrivals, special promotions, and flash sales.

Send notifications when a referral is successful or when a new voucher is available for students.

Push notifications should be sent to students when their referral results in an earned voucher or reward.

9. Student Discounts & Flash Sales:
Implement a student discount system, offering special discounts on certain products for registered students.

Run flash sales for quick product turnover or for promoting specific categories or deals.

Allow the admin to create and schedule flash sales.

10. Design Preferences:
Color scheme: Student-friendly, youthful, and vibrant. Focus on easy navigation and accessibility.

Font: Clear and legible, with a modern, minimalistic style.

Logo and branding should reflect the university environment, with a professional yet approachable feel.

The website should be fully responsive and look great on both desktop and mobile devices.
